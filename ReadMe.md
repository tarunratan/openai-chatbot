# OpenAI Chatbot Script

This Bash script allows you to chat with an OpenAI-powered chatbot using the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. The conversation history is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which allows you to continue the conversation later.


## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, you'll need to make sure you have the following installed and set up:

### OpenAI API Key

To use the OpenAI chatbot, you'll need a valid OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key by creating an account on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and following the instructions to create an API key.

### PostgreSQL Database

You'll also need a PostgreSQL database to store the conversation history. You can download and install PostgreSQL from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or use a cloud-hosted service like [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres). Once you have PostgreSQL installed, create a database and a table named `conversation_history` with the following columns:

-   `session_id`: A unique identifier for the conversation session (e.g., user ID or randomly generated ID)
-   `message`: The message sent by the user or the AI chatbot

**Create a `conversation_history` table in your PostgreSQL database:**

    `CREATE TABLE conversation_history (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
        message TEXT NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() );`

### Environment Variables

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script, containing the following environment variables:


    API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>

    PGUSER=<your_postgres_username>

    PGPASSWORD=<your_postgres_password>

    PGHOST=<your_postgres_host>

    PGPORT=<your_postgres_port>

    PGDATABASE=<your_postgres_database>

Replace the values in angle brackets with your own API key and PostgreSQL credentials.

## Usage

To start the chatbot script, run the following command in your terminal:

bashCopy code

`./chatbot.sh` 

You'll see the prompt `>` , where you can type your message to the chatbot. The chatbot will respond with a message generated by the OpenAI API.

To exit the chatbot session, type `exit` at the prompt.

## Modifying the Script

If you'd like to modify the script to use a different OpenAI model, you can change the `model` variable in the `curl` command. You can find a list of available OpenAI models in the [API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview).

You can also modify the script to store additional information in the conversation history table, such as timestamps or metadata.
